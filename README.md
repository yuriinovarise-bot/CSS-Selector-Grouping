CSS Selector Grouping
Description

In CSS, sometimes you need to apply the same style to multiple elements. Instead of writing the same property for each selector separately, you can group them using commas. This helps keep your CSS code shorter and cleaner.

Task

Simplify the given code by grouping selectors:

h1 {
	text-align: center;
}
h2 {
	text-align: center;
}
h3 {
	text-align: center;
}

Goal

Learn how to group multiple selectors with the same properties.

Reduce duplication in your CSS.
